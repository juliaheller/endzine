            <p class="text">THE END is an upcoming Zine about the Apocalypse.
                The World as we know it is coming to an End - be
                it through climate changes that cause dramatic change
                in the environment, be it through a collapse of economic
                sytems, be it through the usurpation of power by fascist forces.
                All these phenomena are interlinked and catalysing each other anyway.
                We, humans of the current century, have to deal with the imminent end
                of the way we lead our lives. This can be depressing, devastating.
                It can also be hopeful, exciting. We have to deal with it and that is
                what THE END is going to do. Many different people are coming together
                to create this self published, non-profit Zine with beautiful, fascinating,
                engaging content of all kinds of media: illustration, song, prose, comic, poem,
                photography, painting etc.
                <br>THE END will be released on the 5th of September 2020 at the big Release Party in Berlin.
                <br>YOU can still contribute! Just drop a note - the Apocalypse is for all of us!
                <br>Stay tuned for upcoming info...

            <h2>What‘s a Zine?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                A Zine is something like a magazine - just not »professional«, i.e. with a budget and a publisher. Back
                in the days and
                still today zines are often created by a single person, printed at home, stitched together by hand. The
                plan for The
                End, though, is to get it printed by a company in a small number, depending on money raised by
                crowdfunding, preorder
                and personal expense.
            </p>


            <h2>What‘s the Apocalypse?</h2>
            <p class="text">It‘s a lot. Many different ideas and meanings. Currently a lot of people feel the Corona
                crisis is the
                Apocalypse...
                Anyway, whatever it is, it has to do with big things ending. Society, nature, humankind - either they
                cease
                existing
                completely or they just change in a drastic way that unhinges our lives. That‘s what this Zine is about.
            </p>


            <h2>What‘s in it?</h2>

            <p class="text">A lot of people have been contributing content (without payment!). Fiction and essays, comics and
            illustrations, fotos
            and memes, poems and a song that you will be able to listen to online via QR code. Basically everything is
            allowed, all
            kinds of artistic expression dealing with the End of the World.</p>

            <h2>What comes out?</h2>

            <p class="text">There will be one printed issue of The End. Page count might be around 40.
            The number of copies and ways of distrubition are still to be determined, stay tuned. The price will depend
            on the
            production costs and only serve to cover them as well as other expenses. It will be kept as low as possible.
            You will probably be able to purchase a copy, if you contact me, Julia Freier, the head behind this project.</p>

            <h2>Who are the people contributing?</h2>

            <p class="text">Friends, mostly. Old friends and new friends, some of them I befriended by asking them to make a
            contribution to this project. Some of them are artists, some are not or didn‘t know they were. I would say there is a certain
            tendency to leftist intersectional feminism as a common feature in this group but that may just be my personal bubble.
            They all contributed without receiving any kind of payment.

            <h2>Who is Julia Freier?</h2>

           <p class="text"> Hi, that‘s me! I am a graphic designer and illustrator from Berlin. I am a white cis woman, poor and queer,
            creative and mother. I love many aspects of my graphic design job - drawing, designing, layouting, working with clients.
            Furthermore I love working with people, connecting, joining forces and ideas. So this project is the incarnation of my
            passion. It would be cool if I got paid for it, but you can‘t have it all, right? </p>

            <h2>Why a Zine about the Apocalypse?</h2>

            <p class="text">Storytime. I wanted to make a zine because I wanted to do some creative project on my own conditions. I
            pondered about the motive. Than I realised that every conversation I had with any person somehow at some point touched the
            end of the world. The idea seemed to be everywhere. On Netflix, at parties, in my own mind. So there was my topic.
            That was in summer 2019. Now reality has caught up with art and as I am writing this, there is a worldwide
            pandemia that feels pretty apocalyptic...</p>

            <h2>What can you do?</h2>

            <p class="text">Would you like to contribute? Awesome, hit me up! Slots are closing slowly, but we‘ll see if we can still
            squeeze you in.
            Share the project with your friends, your bubble, your followers. The more, the merrier!
            Hit me up, if you want to buy a copy. The more preorders I get, the better I can plan and estimate the total
            cost.
            Stay tuned for the crowdfunding campaign and then through in some money.
            Send some appreciative words, we all need positive energy these days.</p>
