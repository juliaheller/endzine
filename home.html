            <p class="text">THE END is an upcoming Zine about the Apocalypse. 
               The World as we know it is coming to an End - be 
               it through climate changes that cause dramatic change 
               in the environment, be it through a collapse of economic 
               sytems, be it through the usurpation of power by fascist forces. 
               All these phenomena are interlinked and catalysing each other anyway. 
               We, humans of the current century, have to deal with the imminent end
               of the way we lead our lives. This can be depressing, devastating. 
               It can also be hopeful, exciting. We have to deal with it and that is 
               what THE END is going to do. Many different people are coming together 
               to create this self published, non-profit Zine with beautiful, fascinating, 
               engaging content of all kinds of media: illustration, song, prose, comic, poem, 
               photography, painting etc.
            <br>THE END will be released on the 5th of September 2020 at the big Release Party in Berlin. 
            <br>YOU can still contribute! Just drop a note - the Apocalypse is for all of us!
            <br>Stay tuned for upcoming info...
